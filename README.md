# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: euclid-creator-bot 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/2fe7d02e-b8ea-4014-88f3-a6283aa7b9ab/improve

**Description**: I want to create a website about a product called Euclid. It's an AI dev tool that autonomously builds web apps by talking to users. Above the fold, I want to have a futuristic hero image and 3 buttons. One button should open a popup with a youtube video playing (here is the video URL - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g-1cPGK0GA), the other one should open the examples page (we'll get to this after the initial page) and the third should open the VS Code marketplace to download the app (here is the link to the marketplace - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PythagoraTechnologies.gpt-pilot-vs-code)

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
